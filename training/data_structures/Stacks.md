# Stacks

- `stack<type>`
- elements can only be retrieved in order of insertion
    - `stack::push()` : insert element on top of stack
    - `stack::pop()` : retrieve last element and remove it from stack
    - `stack::empty()` : is it empty?
- like a pile of objects

## Queue

- `queue<type>`
- first in, first out

## Deque

- `deque<type>` = double ended queue
- retrieval and removal from both ends
