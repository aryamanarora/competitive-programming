# USACO

These are solution to many algorithmic problems I've done for practice in preparation for the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO). Most problems are from Codeforces (prefix: CF) and are solved in C++, but there are also problems from Kattis (KAT), CodeChef (CC), Infoarena (IA), UVA Online Judge (UVA), and AtCoder (ATC).

Also included are solutions from programming contests.
